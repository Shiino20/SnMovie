    "Description": "The Silverlight version of AutoMapper seems to be broken.\n \nI tried the merged version first but when you try to add a reference to it in Visual Studio it complains that it is not a Silverlight assembly. Taking a look at it in reflector I noticed it references mscorlib version 2.0.0.0 instead of the Silverlight version 2.0.5.0.\n \nNext I tried the unmerged version but that blows up at runtime with a MethodAccessException when trying to use System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod..ctor(String, Type, Type[], Type, Boolean). This method is restricted and cannot be used from application code. Checking with reflector I see this is used from DelegateFactory.CreateDynamicMethod and DelegateFactory.CreateValueTypeSet.",
