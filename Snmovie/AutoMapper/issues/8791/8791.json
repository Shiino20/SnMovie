    "Description": "Hello,\n\nI am working on a project using .Net technologies. In our peoject, we are using Entity Framework/Linq/Automapper/POCO.\n\nWe use below functions of Automapper as - \n1. Automapper.CreateMap() - to declare maps.\n2. Automapper.Mapper.Map() - to map source to destination type (i.e. Data Access object to POCO entities).\n\nBut, somehow Automapper is giving performance hit to some extent. So, I was trying to figure out am I making correct use of the plug in?\n\nIt would be great if I could get valuable help from anyone who has worked/studied about this plug-in.\n\nThanks in advance!",
