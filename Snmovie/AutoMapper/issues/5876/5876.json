    "Description": "Hi,\nI encounter an issue with the result of TypeMap.GetSourceValueResolvers().\nI can cast the result to IMemberResolver, but it fails if I try to cast to IMemberGetter.\nI need to do that for reasons detailled here (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3405149/how-to-find-the-source-property-based-on-the-name-of-a-flattened-property-with-au/4076840#4076840)\n \nIs there something special to do to be able to do that (implement something on my mapped objects for example) ?\n \nThank you very much",
