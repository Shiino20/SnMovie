    "Description": "I found another bug concerning mapping nullable types with AutoMapper.  I'm using the latest release (r87).  It looks like simple mappings work correctly with nullable types, but mappings from a nullable property on one class to a property of a nested class in the target class does not work.  I've attached a simple NUnit test fixture to demonstrate the bug.",
