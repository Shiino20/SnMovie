    "Description": "There is no support for multithreading work now as I see. I think it would be good desing choose to redevelop from static objects to non-static objects, like:\nMapperInstance mapper = Mapper.CreateMapper();\nmapper.CreateMap<TA, TB>();\n.....\nvar result = mapper.Map<TA, TB>(source);",
