    "Description": "Here's a small example case where polymorph mapping works and fails:\ninterface IBase { }\ninterface IDerived : IBase { }\nclass Base : IBase { }\nclass Derived : Base, IDerived { }\nclass BaseDto { }\nclass DerivedDto : BaseDto { }\n \nand following mappings:\nMapper.CreateMap<Base, BaseDto>().Include<Derived, DerivedDto>();\nMapper.CreateMap<Derived, DerivedDto>();\n// try with and without the following two lines, also try with just the following two lines\nMapper.CreateMap<IBase, BaseDto>().Include<IDerived, DerivedDto>();\nMapper.CreateMap<IDerived, DerivedDto>();\n \nList<Base> list = new List<Base>() { new Derived() };\nConsole.WriteLine(Mapper.Map<IEnumerable<Base>, BaseDto[]>(list).First().GetType() == typeof(DerivedDto));\n \nIf the interface mappings are not created, the Console will output True as expected and documented. However if only the interface mappings are created it will output False. I had hoped that it would have worked with just the interfaces (even though I understand that this may be difficult with multiple interface inheritance), but I didn't expect that it doesn't work anymore when interface mappings were created _in addition_ to the class mappings.",
