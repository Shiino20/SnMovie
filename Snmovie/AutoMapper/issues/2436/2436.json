    "Description": "Adding computed, read-only properties to the destination mapping type and not explicitly .ForMember(m => m.ReadOnlyProperty, p=> p.Ignore()) -ing them throws a superfluous AutoMapperConfigurationException saying that these properties are not mapped.  Seeing as how it is impossible to map to read-only properties, AutoMapper should check this first before throwing this exception.\nÂ \nAlso, an AssertConfigurationIsValid that only validates Profile configurations would be immensely useful.  When testing and refactoring my own code, I don't want to be responsible for validating other team members' potentially invalid AutoMapper Profiles.",
