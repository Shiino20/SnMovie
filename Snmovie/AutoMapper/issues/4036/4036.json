    "Description": "Hi,\n \nI'd like to suggest to optionally specify a name for a mapping allowing to have multiple mappings of the same type with different configurations.\n \ne.g. Mapper.CreateMap<Order, OrderDto>(\"OrderMapping\");\n \nI see a lot of value in that especially in combination with the Ignore configuration.\n \nIn one of my projects I currently implemented my own mapper which maps nested objects based on input parameters. Some of my service requests allow the consumer to specify whether nested collections are loaded. For example in one instance a consumer wants to load a collection of orders without having the details such as the products attached. In an other instance the consumer may want to retrieve orders with associated products. The mapping for both cases would be of the same type but the Ignore configuration would be different.\n \nThis is similar to unity where you can configure a type and a name to distinguish between various type configurations of the same type. :)",

      "Message": "So typically we would create multiple destination types to separate the different scenarios.  In your suggestion, you would then be required to specify the named map on the map side:\r\n\r\nMapper.Map<Order, OrderDto>(order, \"OrderMapping\");\r\n\r\nIs that right?  Obviously the default map wouldn't need the map name.",
