    "Description": "I have a complex object and using a custom resolver to resolve the values for its properties.  I was wondering if there is a way to specify a sequence or order in which the properties will be resolved.  For example, if I have 3 properties in an object: Property1, Property2 and Property3, which appear in the object in that order.  However, Property1 depends on Property3, so I need to resolve Property3 before I resolve Property1.  Is there any way to control that?\n\nThanks,\nAlex",
