    "Description": "I would like to be able to ignore SOURCE properties, as my destination may possibly not include something which the source does. A good example is if you would like to map from a DataContracted type via a service reference. .Net generates some new properties on the type (ExtensionData for example) which I do not want my target to have to implement.\n \nCan I do this at the moment, or is this a new feature request?\n \nThanks.",
