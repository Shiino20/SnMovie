    "Description": "It appears that there is no way to register mappings without providing a reference to the static MapperRegistry. While a static wrapper around non-static registration, as a helper, would be fine, the requirement for static registration is problematic - even if the implementation is actually thread safe. When unit testing static state in general is bad as it spans individual tests, corrupting those tests. Additionally, while the self-test method on AutoMapper is cool, it is also a static method (which in turn relies on static registration). This is also bad in that unit tests executing concurrently are sharing state, and thread safety doesn't resolve the resulting cross-test corruption. It would be *much* better for AutoMapper to be fully non-static apart from optional helpers.",
