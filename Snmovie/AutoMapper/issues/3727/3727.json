      "Message": "Presumably this refers to not being required to make calls to CreateMap<T>(S, D). I want to use this product but it seems unfortunate that you need to manually define maps when that could be calculated automatically the first time that a call is made to Map<T>.",

      "Message": "Patches are always welcome!  And as for waiting for the first time to call Map<T>, check out DynamicMap.  It creates the map the first time.  Of course, you lose configuration validation, which pretty much relegates that feature to anonymous types IMO.",
