    "Description": "I'm reading from an Excel file and depending on the data in the columns the datareader might think the type is a double or a string.  My destination type is a string and when the source type is a double it seems that the method returned from DataReaderMapper.CreateBuilder is failing.  When it fails the properties on the objects do not seem to exist I have attached a screenshot from Studio's debugger of one of the objects.  The blue rectangles should have property names.",
