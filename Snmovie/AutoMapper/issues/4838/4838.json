    "Description": "For mapping database side objects to dto objects, I am using auto mapper. these two kind of objects are in independent projects and the project witch contains dto objects has a reference to another project. I dont have any problem with mapping real objects to dtos. but in a special case ,the real object has some relations to the other objects and dto object should flatten it, then I have to use \"using Convert\" method, but it seems that this configuration wont work if I use it in dto project and I have to reconfigure it in the other project. how can I solve this prpoblem without reconfiguring mapping ?",
