    "Description": "I've got a property, Id, defined on an interface, IBase.  I have a derived interface, IDerived, which inherits the Id property from IBase.  Trying to map IDerived to a simple class with an Id property is failing (e.g. CreateMap<IDerived, Destination>()).  I've attached a simple code file to expose this issue.  Perhaps there is another part of the API that I need to exercise, but this seems like a standard mapping it should support by default.\nÂ \nThanks - Jordan",
