    "Description": "Why are all my Visual Studio test results “Not executed” : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/525578/why-are-all-my-visual-studio-test-results-not-executed\n \n-----\n \nThis is not really a bug but rather a request for assistance. I am trying to follow the tutorial \"The Big Boy MVC Series\" (http://www.weirdlover.com/2010/07/01/the-big-boy-mvc-series-part-22-whoop/).\n \nIn part 22, step 5, we have to add a reference to AutoMapper. What I did in the two projects (Web & Test) . But immediatly after that, all my unit tests do not run any more. As you can see, they don't fail, they are just \"Not Executed\" : http://twitpic.com/21p30v\n \nFeatures of my solution:\n- MVC 2\n- ASP.NET 3.5\n- Visual Studio 2008 in French\n- AutoMapper.dll: 1.1.0.188\n \nDoes anyone has had this kind of problem?\n \nMerci.\nMichel",
